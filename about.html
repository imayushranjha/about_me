<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated B.Com (Hons) student in my third year at Kirori Mal College,
   Delhi University, and an aspiring Chartered Accountant. Having cleared the CA Intermediate exams through the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), I am currently focused on advancing my knowledge in accounting, auditing, and finance. My goal is to deepen my expertise in the financial sector, with a keen interest in audit and financial analysis roles..</p>

<p>My academic journey has equipped me with a solid grounding in microeconomics, business economics, and income tax, and I have gained practical experience through internships at the Vishalakshi Foundation, where I contributed to social impact initiatives, and in an HR role with Pehchan, where I honed my interpersonal and organizational skills.</p>

<p>With a growing interest in technology, I am also learning SQL to enhance data management and analytical skills relevant to my CA articleship. In the near future, I aspire to bring my analytical skills and dedication to a position as an Audit Assistant or similar roles in reputed firms like Deloitte. Driven by a commitment to excellence, I am eager to contribute meaningfully to the field of finance and accounting.</p>
